  - Moved `ShadowLinearGradientFill.tsx` to `src/components/shapes/` folder
  - Improved project organization with dedicated shapes directory

- **performance: optimize for reduced repaint cost** - Enhanced performance when size is fixed
  - Optimized shadow component rendering to minimize unnecessary re-renders
  - Improved layout calculation efficiency
  - Reduced computational overhead in shadow property calculations

### üîß Technical Changes

- **Enhanced type system** - Extended shadow type definitions
  - Added `RadialGradientProps` interface with center and radius properties
  - Updated utility functions to support radial gradient detection
  - Improved type safety across shadow components

- **Updated component architecture** - Streamlined shadow component implementation
